# Android Speech-To-Text and Text-To-Speech

Hello, and thank you for getting my plugin!

Here are a few instructions to guide you better through the plugin.

### Quick Setup

Just drop the Prefabs from "Dhlworks/VoiceRecon/Prefabs" into your scene and setup them to your liking. 

If you've got doubts on what something does, just hover it. Tooltips are provided for each field. Otherwise just look in the source code. Everything is documented!
